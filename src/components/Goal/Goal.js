            <h4>2.1 STUDENTS’ LOYALTY

            </h4>
            <p>One of the major goals of educational institutions is to gain the loyalty of their students. A population of loyal students is a source of competitive advantage to every university. Student loyalty has gained much attention to university (educational institutions), due to the benefits that is been derived from a loyal students. There has been an increase in the level of competition with universities, as a result of student focus to gain knowledge and certification (Disney, 2009).

                Gaining the loyalty of student being one of the major goals of universities, a loyal student is a source of competitive advantages, with an outcome such as positive words of mouth (WOM) communication and retention.

                There are various definitions on student’s loyalty but a simple definition of student loyalty is when an educational institution receives a ultimate reward for its interaction with its students. According to Boulding, Kalra and Zeithaml, (1993) tsays that a student who receives a good service and is satisfied with it, is more likely to be loyal to that institution either through recommending it to others.

                Egan, (2001) defined loyalty as the state of the mind and a basis for developing sustainable advantage. Loyalty of students has to do with “behaviors and attitude of the students

                Dick & Basu (2003) propose two (2) conditions in defining students’ loyalty, which represent the intersection of relative attitude and repeat patronage. First, student who exhibit loyalty behavior, engage in repeated purchase whenever appropriate. Secondly, student who are loyal in attitude are likely to make recommendations to some-else and sometime their loyal attitude will lead to loyal behavior in form of repeat purchase. In order words, students who posses both dimension tend to form a long-term relationship with the institution.</p>
